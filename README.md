## About this Application

This Desktop Application finds out all the saved Wi-Fi from your window system and displays the **Wi-Fi details of specific Wi-Fi profile (SSID name, Authentication, Password).** I know it is simple to get the password by just using CMD and typing commands like *netsh wlan show profile name = "\<profile name>" key=clear"* but that's not everyone is familiar with and you have to manually type the SSID name of that Wi-Fi profile and for some profile like _**Mr.N=**_ you will get the result as _**â€œMr.N=key=clear" is not found on the system**_. The issue with this profile is '__=__' at the end of the SSID name, did you ever think if some SSID's contain emoji's how will you type it in CMD ( ' ', " ", :, etc. If these types of symbols are present in SSID name, then also it is very difficult) but we know that nothing is impossible, you can suppress this problem by using _escape characters like \\ or ^ to escape characters like "" and '' and many more_, **but this Application will list out all the saved Wi-Fi in sorted order and you just had to scroll down and choose the name of the Wi-Fi of whom you want to get the details and you will get all information of that profile including Security Key (Password).**

The other benefit of this application is that **you can manually save the SSID name, Authentication, and Password of any Wi-Fi profile** and when your system comes under that Wi-Fi range, it will automatically get connected to that Wi-Fi network. For example, If you know someoneâ€™s Wi-Fi details and that Wi-Fi is not in the range and your system is never connected to it before, then you can use this application and select the **_'Add Profile'_** option and then enter the details of that Wi-Fi profile, confirm it and details of that Wi-Fi profile will saved to your system and one day when your system detects the frequency of that Wi-Fi (or getting signals from that Wi-Fi Network) _it will automatically get connected, rather than asking for a password for the first time connection establishment_ (like we do for the first time when connecting to any Wi-Fi Network).

*If your system is flooded with too much of Wi-Fi profiles*, going to CMD and selecting the SSID name by typing '_netsh wlan show profiles_' and then selecting the profile and then use delete command with manually typing the SSID name and some time it doesnâ€™t get successful like I mention above that **some SSIDâ€™s contain ambiguous name (like containing symbols, emojis within their name)** and it is very difficult for CMD to parse the command and find out the SSID name but in **_Windows Password Manager_** you can delete it in one click by selecting the Wi-Fi profile in the list and press delete button.
